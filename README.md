## Why Boardom

> ### "***Life is short. Make your time well spent.***" - Lifehack 

Oftentimes we end up doing the same thing in our free time, i.e. watching movies, listening to music, or going out to the restaurant that we already went for fourty times. 

ABC considers the time of our users a top priority. We want to make sure that our users are given vast pool of activities to choose from that actually worth their time and have their spare time well spent. Here we introduce an app that guides our users to try out new things, making their free time fulfilling, more entertaining and exciting.  

## Description 

2020 happened, and we learned a lesson from it. One of the things that we have learned and are continuing to learn from the pandemic is how to cope with boredom and this app could be one of the answers to solving it. Whether an essential worker or not, many of us have most likely experienced physical or mental burn out. Working overtime, working from home or even just being stuck at home, you have probably  faced boredom 

Boardom is an app that will generate a random activity for you to do solo or in a group. You can choose from 9 different activity types. The activity types are: education, recreational, social, diy, cooking, relaxation, music and busywork.
