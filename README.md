## Why Boardom

> ### "***Life is short. Make your time well spent.***" - Lifehack 

Oftentimes we end up doing the same thing in our free time, i.e. watching movies, listening to music, or going out to the restaurant that we already went for fourty times. 

ABC considers the time of our users a top priority. We want to make sure that our users are given vast pool of activities to choose from that actually worth their time and have their spare time well spent. Here we introduce an app that guides our users to try out new things, making their free time fulfilling, more entertaining and exciting.
